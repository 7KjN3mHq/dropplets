Dropplets
=========

> Version 1.0

A minimalist markdown blogging platform that just works.

## What's Markdown?
Markdown is a text formatting syntax inspired on plain text email. It is extremely simple, memorizable and visually lightweight on artifacts so as not to hinder reading.

> The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

If you're looking for an awesome Markdown editor, [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) is a great solution for the Mac. They also have an awesome syntax guide which can be found [here](http://bywordapp.com/markdown/syntax.html).

## Installation
Installing Dropplets is pretty easy. Just follow the few steps below.

1. Download the latest version of Dropplets [here](https://github.com/circa75/dropplets/archive/master.zip).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Drag and drop everything to your server wherever you want it to be installed. 
4. Pull up your target site in a web browser and follow the prompts.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you're not brought to the installation screen after this process, you probably didn't get the `.htaccess` file in the root Dropplets directory. These files are usually hidden by default, so you might have to show hidden files to see it.

## Post Formatting
<<<<<<< HEAD
Posts must currently be composed in markdown format, saved as a `*.txt` and include a matching featured image as follows:

- `your-post-title.txt`
- `your-post-title.jpg`
=======
Posts must currently be composed in markdown format, saved as a "*.md". You may include a matching featured image (optional). Here's an example of good post file naming:

- your-post-title.md
- your-post-title.jpg
>>>>>>> Version 1.0

Post file names are used to structure permalinks. So, a post file saved as `your-post-title.txt` will result in `http://yoursite.com/your-post-title`.

Your posts (markdown files) **MUST** be formatted as follows:

    # Your Post Title
    - Post Author
    - Twitter Handle (e.g. "dropplets")
    - 2020/02/02
    - Post Category
    - Post Status (e.g. "published")

    Your post text starts here.
