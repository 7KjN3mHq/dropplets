Dropplets
=========

A minimalist markdown blogging platform that just works.

## What's Markdown?
Markdown is a text formatting syntax inspired on plain text email. It is extremely simple, memorizable and visually lightweight on artifacts so as not to hinder reading.

> The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

If you're looking for an awesome Markdown editor, Byword (http://bywordapp.com/) is a great solution for the Mac. They also have an awesome syntax guide which can be found Here (http://bywordapp.com/markdown/syntax.html).

## Installation
Installing Dropplets is pretty easy. Just follow the few steps below.

1. Download the latest version here on GitHub.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Drag and drop everything to your server wherever you want it to be installed. 
4. Pull up your target site in a web browser and follow the prompts.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you're not brought to the installation screen after this process, you probably didn't get the "**.htaccess**" file in the root Dropplets directory. These files are usually hidden by default, so you might have to show hidden files to see it.

## Post Formatting
Posts must currently be composed in markdown format, saved in "*.txt" format and include a matching featured image. A good example would be as follows:

- your-post-title.txt
- your-post-title.jpg

Your posts should be formatted as follows:

    # Your Post Title
    - 2020/02/02
    - Post Category

    Your post text goes here

## Important Note
Please note that this is very much a work in progress. Also, I'm not a developer, so there are most likely many ways this could be improved. There is SO MUCH that needs to be done, so please be kind :)
